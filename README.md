# Software-Developer-Internship
This repository contains important projects and task that I completed during my internship as a software developer working on both the front and back end of QBench critical projects that include new features, patch, bug fix, engagement, and design

# Projects Completed
During my internship i completed (code) new features, fixed bug, merge, dev-test, and closed 13 main tasked which include both new feature, patch, and bug fix. And even onmy final day, i had one more task which one 90% completed, but just not enough time to merge, and dev-test its functionality.

|:-----------|:------------:|-------------:|----------:|
| Fix batch dropdown bug QCORE 11017 SE #3275       | Users can add duplicate batches because existing IDs still appear in the dropdown. The filter is incomplete, and testing is not yet finalized.         | Python          | <img width="1890" height="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3819213c-488f-47e0-a8f0-f6523abe67b3" />
| Modify mirage inventory item schema definition to reflect the current migration state #3284       |The Global View in the Inventory Item Landing Page displays without its name, preventing users from saving or deleting it. One related bug is fixed, but further clarification is needed for the remaining issue, and no workaround currently exists.         | SQL         |           |
| QA Bug Report - Inventory Item - Global View not displayed with Name in the Inventory Item landing Page #3293 |The Global View in the Inventory Item Landing Page displays without its name, preventing users from saving or deleting it. One related bug is fixed, but further clarification is needed for the remaining issue, and no workaround currently exists. | Python, HTML5, Jinja2 | 
| Cloning Order with unique field throwing an error QA Bug QCORE-12810 #3317 | Cloning an order with a unique sample-level field causes a 500 error because the unique field value is copied instead of cleared. The expected behavior is to clone the order, sample, and test while leaving the unique field blank. No workaround exists, but functional testing confirms the fix works as intended. | Python | QA Report <img width="692" height="508" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7190fa5e-5212-48e1-936d-3227265d4a96" />
| Se v2.91 dynamic worksheet formatting keyboard shortcuts QCORE-14492 #3437 | This feature allows users to quickly apply bold, italic, underline, and merge/unmerge formatting to J-worksheet cells using toolbar buttons and keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + B, I, U). It improves workflow efficiency by showing shortcuts on hover, supports both Windows and Mac, and respects “Spreadsheet Customization” permissions. Testing focuses on single/multi-cell selections, mixed formatting, and maintaining expected toolbar behavior. | JavaScript, Python | <img width="1830" height="755" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f808ec0-3b66-4caf-bfdb-3f163c572068" />
| Add the ability to auto assign followers to orders QCORE 14189 SE #3370 | This feature automatically assigns designated default followers to Orders, ensuring they receive Customer Portal communications once the order is submitted to the LIMS. Users are only added if they have proper permissions, are active, and not deleted. Implementation leverages Order and Order Request Listeners with settings stored in MongoDB, while testing confirms functionality and handles edge cases. | Python, MongoDB, JavaScript, Jinja2, and HTML5 | New Feature <img width="1820" height="295" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/406fcf60-d383-4f83-959e-64c3c4c24c07" />
| Add orders to email template configuration for alert data type dropdown #3390 | This feature enhances QBench email templates by adding support for Order-Level alerts alongside existing Test-Level alerts. When an “Email Alert” template is selected, a new Data Type dropdown allows users to choose either Tests or Orders, with a corresponding selection list. Previewing the template sends the selected context (tests or orders) to the backend, while permissions ensure users only see orders they are authorized to access. | JavaScript, Jinja2, HTML5, Python | <img width="1074" height="1455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/101e0e60-f572-4ea5-b6ed-fbe9ae583df2" />

| Dollar references aren't been processed when a worksheet is applied t… #3417 | Dollar sign references in dynamic worksheets are not being processed when rendering unsaved batch worksheets in reports or printdocs, causing raw formulas to appear instead of resolved values. There is no existing workaround, and regression testing is required to ensure proper reference processing across tests, batches, samples, and object protocol steps. | Python, JavaScript | <img width="1867" height="864" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3879016d-83d0-4ede-8312-ba6e53f9ac94" />
| QCORE-14716 separate equipment & equipment record user permission #3445 | Separating Equipment and Equipment Record permissions allows technicians to log or edit calibration and maintenance data without modifying equipment details, ensuring proper role-based access control and compliance. Users with edit access to Equipment Records but only read access to Equipment can update records without bypassing approval workflows, reducing security risks and supporting regulated processes. | HTML5, Python
